=========

A pebble watch app which may act as a bike computer.

Currently in development but will allow for a simple interface for tracking things like:
 - Distance
 - Time
 - Pace
 - Altitude

The magic of this app is that it does NOT need another companion app. I have found these companion apps to be either bloated or just too much work to use.

pebbleGPS is implemented with the Pebble.JS framework and completely open source - help me if you want :)

If you would like to donate, I will set up a place for this. I just want to help the world with a useful and simple app - something I have not found yet.
